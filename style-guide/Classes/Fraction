Fractions
----------
Definition: How many parts of a whole we have.

For example, lets say we have a cake and we cut this into four. 
One piece of this is often said as one of four equal parts.
This is written as 1/4.

Now lets take a chocolate and break it into 8 equal parts.
If we select one of them it will be read as One of Eight.
This is written as 1/8
Any one of the pieces cut equally is 1/8 of the whole.


Pie cut into 5. Can you see what does one of this represent 
Correct, this is 1 of 5. 

Circle not cut equally. Can you see what does this one represent. 
Lets assume that 4 friends brought a cake and cut this into 4 like this. 
Think that you got this piece, do you think you would be happy to get this piece?
No, why, this is not cut into equal parts.
So can you call this as 1 of four equal parts? No


Lets take up a problem now. 
If i have a total of 10 balls, 3 of them are red. How do you represent the red balls in fraction of whole. 
Lets draw the 10 balls.
If you take one ball of this it would be 1 of 10
Now we have 3 of them as red, which means 3 of 10 are red. 
How do you write 3 of 10. You are right it is written as 3/10


Comparing Fractions
--------------------
We have learned that fractions are written as 1/4, 2/3. 
X/y Mathematicians call x as numerator and y as denominator 

denominator typically represents how many equal pieces 
numerator typically represents how many of the equal parts

For example when we say 1/6 represents 1 of 6 equal pieces
another example 3/9 represents 3 of 9 equal parts.

Lets take one of the earlier examples where the chocolate is broken into 7 equal parts.
If we take 3 of them what do we write this as. You are correct, this is written as 3 of 7.
If we take 4 of them what do you write. Right you write this as 4 of 7.
Which is larger 4/7 Or 3/7?. Which chocolate would you like to have. Which one is greater or bigger. 

You are correct. 4 of 7 is larger than 3 of 7. 

How do we write this mathematically. The same way we write 4> 3, we write 4/7> 3/7

Greater than the wider side is near to the larger part and the smaller of the pointed end is towards the smaller.

Now lets take 3/7 and 3/4 which one is bigger. 

Lets see, first block i color 3 and second block i color 3 which one is bigger?

You are correct, 3/4 is larger. 

3/7 - 3/4
3/4 - 2/4
2/4 - 3/6

Now lets look at representing this in a different way other than using chocolates

Lets draw a number line from 0 to one.
How do we break this line into 1/2
How do we break this line into 2/4
How do we break this line into 4/8
How do we break this line into 3/8

Can you put this in the ascending order. Which means smallest to the largest?

Comparing fractions with the same denominator
---------------------------------------------
2/4 VS 3/4 chocolates
5/8 VS 3/8 on number line
Easy isnt it?

Comparing fractions with the different denominator
---------------------------------------------------

1/3 VS 1/5 think of chocolates
If 3 friends are going to share a chocolate. They would get 1/3 of a chocolate. 
On their way, 2 more friends join them. Now they will have to share the same chocolate with all five.
How would we share the chocolate now?
This would become 1/5 of a chocolate. 

Who would get larger pieces, the three friends OR the 5 friends?
What did we understand from here? The larger the denominator, the smaller the pieces is going to be. 
Why is that? This is because you are dividing into more Equal chunks.
In the first example you are dividing it into 3 equal pieces. 
In the second example you are dividing it into 5 equal pieces. 

2/3 VS 2/5
You have to cut this into 3 where as you have to cut this into 5 which would have a larger size?
